## üéØ How to Use in Class

### Before Class
1. **Setup:** Ensure all dashboards are working on your system
2. **Preparation:** Review the learning objectives for each dashboard
3. **Customization:** Modify parameters or add new features as needed

### During Class

#### Introduction (5-10 minutes)
- **Demonstrate:** Show the dashboard with default settings
- **Explain:** Connect to theoretical concepts from the tutorial
- **Motivate:** Explain why this topic matters in real-world applications

#### Guided Exploration (15-20 minutes)
- **Scaffold:** Start with simple parameters and gradually increase complexity
- **Question:** Ask students to predict outcomes before running simulations
- **Discuss:** Compare theoretical vs empirical results

#### Student Investigation (20-30 minutes)
- **Challenge:** Present the dynamic problem from each dashboard
- **Explore:** Let students experiment with different parameters
- **Analyze:** Guide them to discover patterns and insights

#### Synthesis (10-15 minutes)
- **Summarize:** Key takeaways from the exploration
- **Connect:** Link back to theoretical concepts
- **Extend:** Discuss real-world applications

### After Class
- **Assignment:** Students can continue exploring at home
- **Extension:** Challenge students to modify or extend the dashboards
- **Assessment:** Use dashboard outputs for homework or projects

## üß© Dynamic Problems for Each Dashboard

### Dashboard 1: Probability Building Blocks
**Problem:** Design an experiment with 3 dice where the sum is between 10-15. What's the probability of this event? Verify your calculation by running 1000 trials.

**Student Actions:**
- Set up experiment parameters
- Define custom events
- Run simulations
- Compare theoretical vs empirical probabilities

### Dashboard 4: Monte Carlo œÄ Estimator
**Problem:** How many samples do you need to estimate œÄ to 3 decimal places? Design an experiment to find out.

**Student Actions:**
- Run simulations with different sample sizes
- Record errors and convergence rates
- Plot error vs sample size
- Predict requirements for higher precision

### Dashboard 7: Secretary Problem
**Problem:** What if you want to hire someone in the top 20% instead of the absolute best? Find the optimal look percentage for this goal.

**Student Actions:**
- Test different look percentages
- Track success rates for modified objectives
- Compare strategies
- Explore variant problems

### Dashboard 6: Brownian Motion
**Problem:** Simulate a stock price with Œº=0.1 and œÉ=0.2. What's the probability it doubles in 1 year? Verify with 1000 simulations.

**Student Actions:**
- Set up GBM parameters
- Run multiple simulations
- Calculate doubling probabilities
- Compare with theoretical expectations

## üîß Customization and Extension

### Adding New Features
Each dashboard is modular and can be easily extended:

```python
# Example: Add new experiment type to Dashboard 1
def calculate_sample_space(experiment_type: str, num_items: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    if experiment_type == "New Experiment":
        # Add your custom logic here
        pass
```

### Creating New Dashboards
Use the existing dashboards as templates:

1. **Copy structure** from an existing dashboard
2. **Modify functions** for your specific topic
3. **Add interactive elements** using Streamlit widgets
4. **Include learning objectives** and dynamic problems

### Integration with Other Tools
