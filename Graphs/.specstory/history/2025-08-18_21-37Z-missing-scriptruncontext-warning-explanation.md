_**Assistant**_

I can see you're getting repeated warnings about missing ScriptRunContext when running your Streamlit application. This is a common issue that occurs when Streamlit is run outside of its normal execution environment. Let me first examine your current code to understand the structure and then help you resolve this issue.


---

Read file: interactive_graph_dashboards.py

---

Now I can see the issue. The warnings you're seeing are related to Streamlit's internal context management when running outside of its normal execution environment. This commonly happens when:

1. Running Streamlit code directly with Python instead of the `streamlit run` command
2. Running in certain IDEs or development environments
3. Running in "bare mode" (outside of Streamlit's web server context)

Let me help you resolve this by creating a proper way to run your Streamlit application and also provide an alternative approach to suppress these warnings.

<details><summary>Edit file: interactive_graph_dashboards.py</summary>

I will add warning suppression at the top of the file to handle the ScriptRunContext warnings and also add a proper main guard to ensure the app runs correctly.

Now let me create a proper `pyproject.toml` file to manage dependencies with `uv` as specified in your user rules:

Now let me create a simple script to run the Streamlit application properly:

I will create a simple script to run the Streamlit dashboard using uv as specified in the user rules.

Now let me create a simple shell script as an alternative way to run the dashboard:
