# Creating general use Python environments (2025-08-18 21:32Z)

_**User**_

ok, I"m having problems with my python enviroinments. Is it possible to create a  couple of 'general use' uv envs? like conda envs? Those should be created at /home/olmozavala/uv/envs and the first one should be called class_4221 and should contain al lthe pacakges defined in @pyproject.toml

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a general-use uv environment similar to conda environments. Let me first check your current pyproject.toml to understand the dependencies, then create the environment.


---

Read file: pyproject.toml

---

Now I'll create the general-use uv environment called `class_4221` at the specified location with all the packages from your pyproject.toml:


---

```bash
mkdir -p /home/olmozavala/uv/envs
```

```
(base) morpheus@Graphs$ mkdir -p /home/olmozavala/uv/envs
(base) morpheus@Graphs$
```
