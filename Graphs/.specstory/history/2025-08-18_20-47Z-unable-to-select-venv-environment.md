# Unable to select .venv environment (2025-08-18 20:47Z)

_**User**_

why I can't select the .venv environment

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you troubleshoot the issue with selecting the `.venv` environment. Let me first examine your current project structure and configuration to understand what might be causing the problem.


---

Read file: interactive_graph_dashboards.py

---

Now let me check your project configuration files to understand the environment setup:


---

Read file: pyproject.toml

---

Read file: requirements.txt

---

Now let me check if there's a virtual environment already created and what the current directory structure looks like:


---

```bash
ls -la
```

```

Great! I can see that you do have a `.venv` directory in your project. Let me check what's inside it and also check the current Python environment:


---

```bash
ls -la .venv/
```

```
(base) morpheus@Graphs$ ls -la .venv/

---

```bash
which python
```

```
(base) morpheus@Graphs$ which python
/home/olmozavala/miniconda/bin/python
(base) morpheus@Graphs$
```

---

```bash
uv --version
```

```
(base) morpheus@Graphs$ uv --version
uv 0.7.18
```

---

Now I understand the issue! You have a `.venv` directory created, but you're currently using the base conda environment instead of the project's virtual environment. Let me help you activate the correct environment and ensure it's properly set up.

The issue is that you need to activate the `.venv` environment that was created by `uv`. Here's how to fix it:


---

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```
(base) morpheus@Graphs$ source .venv/bin/activate
(interactive-graph-dashboards) (base) morpheus@Graphs$
```

---

Great! Now let's verify that the environment is properly activated and check if the dependencies are installed:


---

```bash
which python
```

```
(interactive-graph-dashboards) (base) morpheus@Graphs$ which python
/home/olmozavala/Dropbox/MyCourses/2025/ISC_4221C_Discrete_Algorithms_for_Science_Applications/Examples_2025/Gr
aphs/.venv/bin/python
(interactive-graph-dashboards) (base) morpheus@Graphs$
```

---

Perfect! Now let's check if the dependencies are installed in this environment:


---

```bash
python -c "import streamlit, networkx, plotly, pandas, numpy; print('All dependencies are installed!')"
```

```
(interactive-graph-dashboards) (base) morpheus@Graphs$ python -c "import streamlit, networkx, plotly, pandas, n
(interactive-graph-dashboards) (base) morpheus@Graphs$ python -c "import streamlit, networkx, plotly, pandas, n
umpy; print('All dependencies are installed!')"
bash: !': event not found
(interactive-graph-dashboards) (base) morpheus@Graphs$ ^C
(interactive-graph-dashboards) (base) morpheus@Graphs$
```

---

Let me try a different approach to check the dependencies:


---

```bash
python -c "import streamlit; print('streamlit installed')"
```

```
(interactive-graph-dashboards) (base) morpheus@Graphs$ python -c "import streamlit; print('streamlit installed'
(interactive-graph-dashboards) (base) morpheus@Graphs$ python -c "import streamlit; print('streamlit installed'
)"
streamlit installed
```

---

```bash
python -c "import networkx, plotly, pandas, numpy; print('All other dependencies installed')"
```

```
(interactive-graph-dashboards) (base) morpheus@Graphs$ python -c "import networkx, plotly, pandas, numpy; print
(interactive-graph-dashboards) (base) morpheus@Graphs$ python -c "import networkx, plotly, pandas, numpy; print
('All other dependencies installed')"
All other dependencies installed
```

---

Excellent! Now let's test running your Streamlit application:


---

```bash
uv run streamlit run interactive_graph_dashboards.py
```

_**Assistant**_

I can see from the logs that Cursor is having trouble with the Python interpreter selection. The issue is that Cursor is trying to use a conda environment (`/home/olmozavala/miniconda3/envs/widgets/bin/python`) that doesn't exist, but it has successfully detected your project's virtual environment at the correct path.

The good news is that the last line shows:
```
Active interpreter [/home/olmozavala/Dropbox/MyCourses/2025/ISC_4221C_Discrete_Algorithms_for_Science_Applications/Examples_2025/Graphs]:  /home/olmozavala/Dropbox/MyCourses/2025/ISC_4221C_Discrete_Algorithms_for_Science_Applications/Examples_2025/Graphs/.venv/bin/python
```

This means Cursor has successfully selected your `.venv` environment! The issue you were experiencing has been resolved.

To confirm everything is working properly, let me check the current Python interpreter and run your application:


---

```bash
which python
```

---

Since Cursor has already detected and selected the correct `.venv` environment, you should now be able to:

1. **Run your Streamlit application** by using the terminal in Cursor:
   ```bash
   uv run streamlit run interactive_graph_dashboards.py
   ```

2. **Or run it directly with the activated environment**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run interactive_graph_dashboards.py
   ```

3. **Use the Python interpreter in Cursor** - The logs show that Cursor has successfully selected your project's `.venv/bin/python` as the active interpreter.

The key points about your environment setup:

- ✅ You have a `.venv` directory created by `uv`
- ✅ All dependencies are installed in the virtual environment
- ✅ Cursor has detected and selected the correct Python interpreter
- ✅ The environment is properly configured with your `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files

The error messages you saw earlier were just Cursor trying to find other Python environments on your system, but it ultimately found and selected the correct one for your project.

You should now be able to run your interactive graph dashboards without any environment selection issues!
