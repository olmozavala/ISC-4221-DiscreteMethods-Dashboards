# Interactive Graph Algorithms Dashboard Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the interactive Python dashboards designed for teaching discrete algorithms concepts in graph theory. Each dashboard focuses on specific algorithms and concepts, providing hands-on, visual learning experiences.

## Dashboard Summary Table

| Topic | Dashboard Idea | Student Action | Key Insight |
|-------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Graph Representations** | Interactive comparison of adjacency matrix, adjacency list, and edge list representations with real-time visualization | Students can switch between different graph types, highlight vertex connections, analyze complexity trade-offs, and compare representations for different use cases | Different graph representations optimize for different operations - adjacency matrix for fast edge lookups, adjacency list for space efficiency, edge list for simplicity |
| **Graph Traversal (DFS vs BFS)** | Step-by-step visualization of depth-first and breadth-first search algorithms with data structure state tracking | Students can choose starting vertices, step through algorithms, compare traversal orders, and use BFS to find shortest paths between vertices | BFS explores level-by-level and guarantees shortest paths in unweighted graphs, while DFS goes deep and is better for cycle detection and topological sorting |
| **Shortest Path (Dijkstra's)** | Interactive weighted graph visualization with step-by-step Dijkstra's algorithm execution and distance array updates | Students can watch greedy choices being made, observe distance arrays updating in real-time, compare results with BFS, and reconstruct shortest paths | Dijkstra's greedy approach of always selecting the unvisited node with minimum distance works because once a node is visited, its distance is guaranteed to be optimal |
| **Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's)** | Visual demonstration of Kruskal's algorithm with Union-Find data structure and cycle detection | Students can step through edge selection, watch Union-Find components merge, visualize the growing MST, and modify graphs to observe MST changes | Kruskal's greedy strategy of adding the cheapest edge that doesn't create a cycle works because the optimal solution must include the minimum weight edge between any two components |
