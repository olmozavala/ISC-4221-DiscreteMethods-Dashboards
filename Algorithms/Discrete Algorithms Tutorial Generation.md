Welcome to the fascinating world of algorithm design\! As computer scientists, our goal isn't just to make computers solve problems, but to make them do so *efficiently* and *elegantly*. This tutorial is your guide to the fundamental strategies—the high-level blueprints or paradigms—that form the toolkit of every great programmer. Think of these strategies not as rigid recipes, but as different styles of thinking that you can apply to a vast range of computational problems.

We will embark on a journey through the most common and powerful algorithmic design strategies. Our roadmap will take us from the most straightforward approach to more sophisticated techniques, and finally, we'll learn the language used to measure and compare their performance. Understanding these paradigms will fundamentally change how you approach problem-solving in computer science and beyond.

## **The Brute-Force Approach**

### **Motivation: When in Doubt, Try Everything**

Imagine you've forgotten the 4-digit combination to a padlock. What's your first instinct? You'd probably start at 0000, then try 0001, 0002, and so on, until the lock opens. This methodical, exhaustive trial-and-error process is the essence of the **brute-force** strategy. It's often the first approach we think of because it's conceptually simple and doesn't require any clever tricks.1 While it may not always be the fastest, its directness makes it a surprisingly powerful and widely used tool in computing.

* **Cybersecurity:** The concept of a "brute-force attack" comes directly from this paradigm. To crack a password, an attacker's program will systematically try every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until it finds the correct one.3 This is why password length and complexity are so critical; a longer, more complex password exponentially increases the number of possibilities an attacker must check, making a brute-force attack impractical.5  
* **Data Science:** When building a predictive model, a data scientist might have dozens of potential variables (features). To find the absolute best combination of features, they might employ a brute-force method that builds and evaluates a model for every single possible subset of those features. This is computationally expensive but guarantees finding the optimal combination for the given data.6  
* **Logistics and Puzzles:** For classic problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (finding the shortest route that visits a set of cities), a brute-force approach would calculate the length of every possible tour and pick the shortest one. While this becomes infeasible for many cities, it's a valid solution for a small number. The same logic applies to solving puzzles like Sudoku, where one could try every possible number in every empty square until a valid solution is found.3

While often seen as a "naive" or "first-pass" method, the brute-force approach is a cornerstone of computer science. It serves as a vital baseline for measuring the performance of more advanced algorithms and is a reliable tool when the problem size is small or when the simplicity of implementation is more important than raw speed.

### **The Brute-Force Philosophy: Generate and Test**

The brute-force strategy can be formalized into a simple two-step process known as **generate and test**.

1. **Generate:** Systematically enumerate every possible candidate for the solution.  
2. **Test:** For each candidate, check whether it satisfies the problem's conditions.

The main advantage of this approach is its universality; it can be applied to a wide variety of problems and, given enough time and resources, it is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists.7 Its principal disadvantage is its performance. For many problems, the number of candidate solutions grows explosively with the size of the input, making the brute-force approach too slow to be practical.

### **Brute-Force in Action: Sorting Algorithms**

Sorting an array of numbers is a fundamental problem in computer science. Applying the brute-force mindset leads to some of the most intuitive sorting algorithms.

#### **Selection Sort**

The core idea of Selection Sort is to build the sorted array one element at a time. For each position in the array, we find the smallest element from the remaining unsorted portion and swap it into place.

Explanation:  
The algorithm iterates from the first position to the second-to-last position of the array. In each iteration, it "selects" the smallest element in the subarray to its right and swaps it with the element at the current position.  
Worked Example:  
Let's trace Selection Sort on the array a \= , as shown in the lecture notes.

* **Pass 1 (i=1):**  
  * The current position is a (which is 17).  
  * We scan the rest of the array \`\` to find the smallest element, which is 4\.  
  * We swap a with 4\.  
  * Array becomes: \`\`  
* **Pass 2 (i=2):**  
  * The current position is a (which is 31).  
  * We scan the rest of the array \`\` to find the smallest element, which is 6\.  
  * We swap a with 6\.  
  * Array becomes: \`\`  
* **Pass 3 (i=3):**  
  * The current position is a (which is 31).  
  * We scan the rest of the array \`\` to find the smallest element, which is 17\.  
  * We swap a with 17\.  
  * Array becomes: \`\`

The array is now sorted.

Pseudocode:  
Here is the pseudocode for Selection Sort, assuming the array a is 1-indexed and has n elements.

// Input: an n-element array a  
// Output: the array a sorted in ascending order

for i \= 1 to n-1  
    min\_loc \= i  
    // Find the location of the smallest element in the unsorted part  
    for j \= i+1 to n  
        if (a\[j\] \< a\[min\_loc\])  
            min\_loc \= j  
        end if  
    end for  
    // Swap the found minimum element with the first element  
    swap a\[i\] and a\[min\_loc\]  
end for

#### **Bubble Sort**

Bubble Sort is another simple, brute-force sorting algorithm. Its name comes from the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to their correct positions in the list.

Explanation:  
The algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Passes through the list are repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.1  
Worked Example:  
Let's trace Bubble Sort on the array a \= .

* **Sweep 1:**  
  * Compare 49 and 61\. No swap. Array: \`\`  
  * Compare 61 and 19\. Swap. Array: \`\`  
  * Compare 61 and 12\. Swap. Array: \`\`  
  * The largest element, 61, has "bubbled" to the end.  
* **Sweep 2:**  
  * Compare 49 and 19\. Swap. Array: \`\`  
  * Compare 49 and 12\. Swap. Array: \`\`  
  * Compare 49 and 61\. No swap.  
* **Sweep 3:**  
  * Compare 19 and 12\. Swap. Array: \`\`  
  * Compare 19 and 49\. No swap.  
  * Compare 49 and 61\. No swap.  
* **Sweep 4:**  
  * A full pass is made with no swaps, so the algorithm terminates. The array is sorted: \`\`.

### **Brute-Force in Action: Sequential Search**

The most basic search algorithm is **Sequential Search** (or Linear Search). It embodies the brute-force spirit perfectly.

Explanation:  
Given a list and a search key, the algorithm starts at the first element and checks each element in sequence until either the key is found or the end of the list is reached. It requires no special properties of the list (i.e., it doesn't need to be sorted).  
**Pseudocode:**

// Input: an n-element array a, a search key K  
// Output: the index of the first occurrence of K, or \-1 if not found

for i \= 1 to n  
    if a\[i\] \== K  
        return i // Found it\!  
    end if  
end for  
return \-1 // Reached the end, not found

**Self-Check:** Why are Selection Sort and Bubble Sort considered "brute-force" algorithms? What is the fundamental trade-off of the brute-force paradigm?

## **The Divide and Conquer Strategy**

### **Motivation: The Power of Delegation**

While brute force is simple, it often leads to inefficient algorithms. A more powerful and elegant strategy is **Divide and Conquer (D\&C)**. The core idea is intuitive: if you have a massive, complex problem, break it into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solve those, and then combine their solutions to solve the original big problem.1 It’s like tackling a 5,000-piece jigsaw puzzle by having several friends each work on a different section; once the sections are complete, you can assemble them to finish the whole puzzle much faster than one person could alone.9

* **Big Data and Databases:** Efficiently sorting enormous datasets is a classic application of D\&C. Algorithms like Merge Sort, which are based on this paradigm, are fundamental to the operation of modern database systems and data processing frameworks. They can handle datasets far too large to fit into a computer's main memory.9  
* **Computer Graphics:** Rendering a complex 3D scene for a movie or video game is incredibly demanding. D\&C techniques are used to break the scene into smaller parts (e.g., using a data structure called a quadtree) that can be processed and rendered independently, often in parallel on multi-core processors, before being combined into the final image.12  
* **Network Optimization:** Finding the most efficient way to route data in a large computer network can be tackled with D\&C. The network can be partitioned into smaller sub-networks, optimal routes can be found within each, and these local solutions can be combined to create efficient global routing tables.12

### **The Divide-Conquer-Combine Framework**

A Divide and Conquer algorithm consists of three distinct steps, which are applied recursively 2:

1. **Divide:** Break the given problem into two or more smaller subproblems of the same type. The subproblems should ideally be of roughly equal size.  
2. **Conquer:** Solve the subproblems by calling the same algorithm recursively. If a subproblem becomes small enough (this is called the **base case**), it is solved directly without further recursion.  
3. **Combine:** Merge the solutions of the subproblems to obtain the solution for the original problem.

This recursive structure is a hallmark of D\&C algorithms and is key to their efficiency. By repeatedly breaking the problem down, the algorithm can quickly reach the simple base cases, and the "hard work" is often done in the combine step.

### **A Smarter Search: Binary Search**

One of the most famous algorithms that uses this divide-and-conquer thinking is **Binary Search**. It provides a dramatically faster way to find an element compared to the brute-force Sequential Search.

Explanation:  
Binary Search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It compares the target value with the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare with the target value.1  
**A Critical Prerequisite:** There is one non-negotiable requirement for Binary Search to work: **the data must be sorted**. This constraint is fundamental. If the array is unsorted, the logic of eliminating half the search space at each step breaks down completely.

This highlights a deep connection between different algorithmic tasks. The incredible efficiency of a search algorithm like Binary Search is made possible by the work of a sorting algorithm. This shows that algorithm design is often about creating a pipeline: an efficient sorting algorithm (many of which are themselves based on D\&C, like Merge Sort) acts as a "transform" step that enables a highly efficient search.1

Worked Example:  
Let's trace the search for the number 17 in the sorted array a \= .1 The array has  
n=7 elements. Let's use 0-based indexing, so indices are 0 to 6\.

* **Step 1:**  
  * low \= 0, high \= 6\.  
  * mid \= (0 \+ 6\) / 2 \= 3\.  
  * Compare the target (17) with a (which is 9).  
  * Since 17\>9, the target must be in the right half. We discard the left half by setting low \= mid \+ 1\.  
* **Step 2:**  
  * low \= 4, high \= 6\.  
  * mid \= (4 \+ 6\) / 2 \= 5\.  
  * Compare the target (17) with a (which is 31).  
  * Since 17\<31, the target must be in the left half of this new interval. We discard the right half by setting high \= mid \- 1\.  
* **Step 3:**  
  * low \= 4, high \= 4\.  
  * mid \= (4 \+ 4\) / 2 \= 4\.  
  * Compare the target (17) with a (which is 17).  
  * They match\! The element is found at index 4\.

Notice how in just three comparisons, we found the element in a list of seven. A sequential search could have taken up to five comparisons in this case. This efficiency gain becomes enormous for large arrays.

## **Other Key Algorithmic Strategies**

Beyond Brute Force and Divide and Conquer, several other important paradigms exist. They are often related but have distinct characteristics that make them suitable for different types of problems.

### **Decrease and Conquer**

The **Decrease and Conquer** strategy works by exploiting the relationship between a solution to a given problem and a solution to a *single*, smaller instance of the same problem.1 This is subtly different from Divide and Conquer, which breaks a problem into

*multiple* subproblems.

The process is:

1. **Decrease:** Reduce the problem instance to a smaller instance of the same problem.  
2. **Conquer:** Solve the smaller instance recursively.  
3. **Extend:** Use the solution of the smaller instance to build the solution for the original instance.

Worked Example: Exponentiation  
A brute-force way to calculate π8 is to perform seven multiplications: π×π×⋯×π. A smarter, decrease-and-conquer approach recognizes that π8=(π4)2.1 This reduces the problem of calculating  
π8 to the single smaller problem of calculating π4. We then apply the same logic: π4=(π2)2. Finally, π2=π×π.

The calculation proceeds as follows:

1. Calculate π2=π×π (1 multiplication).  
2. Calculate π4=π2×π2 (1 multiplication).  
3. Calculate π8=π4×π4 (1 multiplication).

This requires only 3 multiplications instead of 7, a significant improvement. This technique, known as exponentiation by squaring, is crucial in fields like cryptography where calculations with very large numbers are common.

Revisiting Binary Search:  
Binary Search is a perfect example of Decrease and Conquer. At each step, the problem of searching in an array of size n is reduced to the single, smaller problem of searching in an array of size roughly n/2. The other half of the array is completely discarded.17 While it's often grouped with Divide and Conquer due to the "dividing" step, its reliance on solving only one subproblem makes it a classic instance of Decrease and Conquer.

### **Transform and Conquer**

The **Transform and Conquer** strategy is a two-stage process where the problem is first modified to make it easier to solve.1

1. **Transform Stage:** The problem instance is changed into a form that is more amenable to solution. This could involve sorting the data, changing its representation (e.g., storing it in a different data structure), or reducing it to a different problem entirely.  
2. **Conquer Stage:** The transformed problem is solved.

Motivation:  
This strategy is common in data processing and machine learning. For example, data is often "transformed" by sorting, normalizing, or converting it into a different format before the main analysis or learning algorithm is applied.18 In mathematics and physics, changing coordinate systems (e.g., from Cartesian to polar coordinates) is a form of transformation that can make solving complex integrals or equations much simpler.1  
Worked Example: Element Uniqueness  
Consider the problem: "Does an array a \= contain any duplicate elements?".1

* **Brute-Force Approach:** Compare every element with every other element. This is slow and requires many comparisons.  
* **Transform and Conquer Approach:**  
  1. **Transform:** Sort the array first. The array becomes \`\`.  
  2. **Conquer:** Scan the sorted array and check if any *adjacent* elements are equal.  
     * Is a \== a (i.e., 4==17)? No.  
     * Is a \== a (i.e., 17==17)? Yes. Stop and report that a duplicate exists.

By first transforming the problem (sorting the data), the conquering stage becomes trivial and much more efficient. This technique of "presorting" is a common and powerful application of the Transform and Conquer paradigm.19

### **Greedy Algorithms**

Greedy algorithms are used for **optimization problems**, where the goal is to find the best possible solution from a set of feasible options. The strategy is to build a solution piece by piece, and at each step, make the choice that seems best at that moment—the **locally optimal** choice—without ever reconsidering past choices.1

Motivation:  
This "take the best you can get right now" approach is used in many real-world systems.

* **Network Routing:** Algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm find the shortest path between two points in a network (like the internet or a road map). At each step, it greedily chooses the next unvisited node that is closest to the starting point.21 This is fundamental to how GPS navigation and internet data packets work.  
* **Scheduling:** Operating systems often use greedy strategies to schedule which process gets to use the CPU next. A common approach is "Shortest Job First," where the system greedily picks the waiting process that will take the least amount of time to complete, minimizing the average wait time for all processes.22  
* **Data Compression:** Huffman coding, a key technique used in file compression (like.zip files), is a greedy algorithm. It builds an optimal encoding by greedily merging the two least-frequent characters at each step.23

Worked Example: The Change-Making Problem  
A classic example is making change with the fewest number of coins.1 Suppose you need to give 41 cents in change using US currency (quarters: 25¢, dimes: 10¢, nickels: 5¢, pennies: 1¢).  
The greedy approach is:

1. Take the largest coin possible without exceeding 41¢: a **quarter** (25¢). Remaining: 41−25=16¢.  
2. Take the largest coin possible without exceeding 16¢: a **dime** (10¢). Remaining: 16−10=6¢.  
3. Take the largest coin possible without exceeding 6¢: a **nickel** (5¢). Remaining: 6−5=1¢.  
4. Take the largest coin possible without exceeding 1¢: a penny (1¢). Remaining: 1−1=0¢.  
   The solution is 1 quarter, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 1 penny (4 coins total). For the US coin system, this greedy approach always yields the optimal solution.

When Greed Fails:  
The most important lesson about greedy algorithms is that they do not always work. Their short-sighted, "locally optimal" nature can lead to a globally suboptimal solution. This is a powerful lesson in analytical thinking: a series of seemingly good short-term decisions can lead to a poor long-term outcome.  
Consider making change for 30¢ using a non-standard coin system: {1¢, 10¢, 25¢} (no 5¢ coin).1

* **Greedy Solution:**  
  1. Take a **quarter** (25¢). Remaining: 5¢.  
  2. Take five **pennies** (5 x 1¢). Remaining: 0¢.  
  * Total coins: 1 \+ 5 \= **6 coins**.  
* **Optimal Solution:**  
  1. Take three **dimes** (3 x 10¢). Remaining: 0¢.  
  * Total coins: **3 coins**.

In this case, the greedy choice to take the 25¢ coin was a mistake that couldn't be undone, leading to a suboptimal result. Determining whether a greedy strategy will work for a given problem requires a deeper mathematical proof of the problem's structure.

| Strategy | Core Idea | Canonical Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Brute Force** | Try every possibility. | Sequential Search |
| **Divide and Conquer** | Split into multiple subproblems, solve each, then combine. | Merge Sort |
| **Decrease and Conquer** | Reduce to one smaller subproblem and solve. | Binary Search |
| **Transform and Conquer** | Change the problem's representation to make it easier. | Finding duplicates by presorting |
| **Greedy** | Make the locally optimal choice at each step. | Change-Making Problem |

---

**Self-Check:** What is the key difference between Divide and Conquer and Decrease and Conquer? Provide an example where a Transform and Conquer approach is more efficient than a Brute-Force one. Why is the failure of the greedy algorithm in the second coin-change example such an important lesson?

## **Analyzing Algorithm Efficiency**

We've now seen several different strategies for solving problems. But how do we formally compare them? How can we say with confidence that Binary Search is "better" than Sequential Search? This requires us to analyze their **efficiency**.

### **Why Efficiency Matters: From Seconds to Centuries**

The choice of algorithm can have a staggering impact on performance, especially as the size of the input data (n) grows. Measuring efficiency by running a program and timing it with a stopwatch is unreliable; the result depends on the specific computer, the programming language, and other running processes.1 We need a platform-independent way to describe an algorithm's performance.

Consider the difference in growth rates for various algorithms. The graph below illustrates how the number of required operations scales with the input size n for different complexity classes.1

*(Descriptive Diagram: A graph with the x-axis as "Input Size (n)" and the y-axis as "Number of Operations". It shows several curves starting from the origin. The log n curve is almost flat. The n curve is a straight diagonal line. The n log n curve is slightly steeper than n. The n^2 curve is a parabola, growing much faster. The n^3 curve is even steeper. Finally, the 2^n and n\! curves skyrocket upwards almost vertically, showing extremely rapid growth.)*

To make this concrete, imagine a computer that can perform one billion operations per second.

* An algorithm with n^2 operations for an input of size n=50,000 would take (50,000)2/109=2.5 seconds.  
* An algorithm with n^3 operations for the same input would take (50,000)3/109≈34.7 hours.  
* An algorithm with 2n operations would be practically impossible for an input size as small as n=100.

This shows that as n gets large, the algorithm's growth rate—not the raw speed of the computer—is the dominant factor in performance.

### **Measuring Work: Computational Cost**

To analyze an algorithm, we don't measure time directly. Instead, we count the number of **basic operations** it performs as a function of the input size n. A basic operation is an instruction that can be considered to take a constant amount of time, such as an assignment, an arithmetic operation, or a comparison.

For sorting and searching algorithms, the most important basic operation is the **comparison**, as it is the core of the decision-making process.

Worked Example: Analyzing Selection Sort  
Let's calculate the total number of comparisons for Selection Sort on an array of size n.  
The pseudocode has two nested loops.

* The outer loop (for i \= 1 to n-1) runs n-1 times.  
* The inner loop (for j \= i+1 to n) is where the comparisons happen.  
  * When i=1, j goes from 2 to n, making n-1 comparisons.  
  * When i=2, j goes from 3 to n, making n-2 comparisons.  
  * ...  
  * When i=n-1, j goes from n to n, making 1 comparison.

The total number of comparisons, C(n), is the sum of this series:  
C(n)=(n−1)+(n−2)+⋯+2+1  
This is the sum of the first n-1 integers. Using the summation formula ∑k=1m​k=2m(m+1)​, with m=n−1, we get:  
C(n)=∑i=1n−1​(n−i)=(n−1)+(n−2)+⋯+1=2(n−1)n​  
C(n)=2n2​−2n​  
This formula tells us the exact number of comparisons Selection Sort will perform.

### **The Language of Efficiency: Big-O Notation**

While the exact cost function C(n)=2n2​−2n​ is precise, it's also cumbersome. For comparing algorithms, we are most interested in the **rate of growth** as n becomes very large. This is where **Big-O notation** comes in.

Big-O notation provides an **asymptotic upper bound** on an algorithm's complexity. It simplifies the cost function to its most dominant term, ignoring constants and lower-order terms.1

The Core Idea: Focus on the Dominant Term  
In the expression 2n2​−2n​, as n gets very large, the n2 term grows much, much faster than the n term. For example, if n is one million, n2 is a trillion, making the n term comparatively insignificant. Big-O notation captures this by focusing only on the fastest-growing term.1  
**Simplification Rules:**

1. **Drop Lower-Order Terms:** An expression like n2+10n+5 is dominated by the n2 term for large n. So, we simplify it to just n2.  
2. **Drop Constant Factors:** An expression like 21​n2 has the same *quadratic* growth rate as n2 or 100n2. Big-O ignores these constant multipliers.

Applying these rules to Selection Sort's cost function, C(n)=2n2​−2n​:

1. Drop the lower-order term −2n​, leaving 2n2​.  
2. Drop the constant factor 21​, leaving n2.

Thus, we say that the time complexity of Selection Sort is O(n2) (read as "Big-O of n-squared" or "order n-squared").

**Quick Rules for Analyzing Loops** :

* A single loop that runs n times is O(n).  
* Two consecutive (not nested) loops that each run n times is O(n)+O(n)=O(2n)=O(n).  
* Two nested loops where both run n times is O(n×n)=O(n2).  
* Two nested loops like in Selection Sort, where the inner loop depends on the outer loop's index, form a triangle of operations. This results in roughly 2n2​ operations, which simplifies to O(n2).

### **Comparing Our Algorithms**

We can now use Big-O notation to formally compare the algorithms we've discussed.

| Algorithm | Strategy | Time Complexity (Big-O) | Key Remarks |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Sequential Search** | Brute Force | O(n) | Simple, works on any list. Performance degrades linearly with size. |
| **Selection Sort** | Brute Force | O(n2) | Simple to implement, but inefficient for large lists. |
| **Bubble Sort** | Brute Force | O(n2) | Also simple, but generally performs worse than Selection Sort in practice. |
| **Binary Search** | Decrease & Conquer | O(logn) | Extremely fast. With each comparison, it halves the search space. **Requires data to be sorted.** |

This table clearly shows the power of choosing a sophisticated strategy. Moving from a brute-force search (O(n)) to a decrease-and-conquer search (O(logn)) provides an exponential speedup, but it comes at the cost of needing sorted data—a perfect example of the trade-offs inherent in algorithm design.

## **Key Takeaways**

* **Algorithmic Strategies** are high-level blueprints (paradigms) for problem-solving, such as Brute Force, Divide and Conquer, and Greedy approaches.  
* **Brute Force** is the most direct strategy: generate and test all possible solutions. It's simple but often inefficient, with complexities like O(n) (Sequential Search) and O(n2) (Selection Sort).  
* **Divide and Conquer** is a powerful recursive technique that breaks a problem into multiple smaller subproblems, solves them, and combines the results. It is the basis for many highly efficient algorithms.  
* **Decrease and Conquer** is a related technique that reduces a problem to a single smaller subproblem. Binary Search, with its O(logn) complexity, is a prime example.  
* **Transform and Conquer** involves changing the problem's representation (e.g., by sorting) to make it easier to solve. This highlights that algorithms can be chained together in a pipeline.  
* **Greedy Algorithms** make locally optimal choices at each step to solve optimization problems. They are fast and simple but are not guaranteed to find the globally optimal solution for all problems.  
* **Big-O Notation** is the standard language for analyzing algorithm efficiency. It describes the algorithm's performance as the input size n grows large, focusing on the dominant term (rate of growth) and ignoring constants and lower-order terms.

## **Practice Problems**

Here are some problems to test your understanding of these concepts.

### **Solutions and Hints**

1\. Solution (Conceptual Question):  
A great example is planning a university course schedule to maximize the number of credits taken, where courses have prerequisites. A greedy approach might be: "At each step, pick the available course with the highest credit value." This could fail spectacularly. You might greedily pick a 4-credit senior seminar that has no prerequisites, but in doing so, you might miss the opportunity to take a 3-credit introductory course that is a prerequisite for ten other advanced courses you wanted to take later. By making the locally optimal choice (most credits now), you block the path to a much better global solution (more total credits over your entire degree).  
2\. Solution (Algorithm Tracing: Sorting):  
Initial array: \`\`

* After Pass 1 (i=0): Smallest element is 1\. Swap with 5\.  
  \`\`  
* After Pass 2 (i=1): Smallest element in the rest is 2\. It's already in place. No swap.  
  \`\`  
* After Pass 3 (i=2): Smallest element in the rest is 3\. Swap with 8\.  
  \`\`  
* After Pass 4 (i=3): Smallest element in the rest is 5\. Swap with 8\.  
  Final sorted array:

3\. Solution (Algorithm Tracing: Searching):  
Array: \`\`, Target: 21

* **Step 1:** low \= 0, high \= 7\. mid \= (0+7)/2 \= 3\. a is 12\. Since 21\>12, set low \= mid \+ 1 \= 4\.  
* **Step 2:** low \= 4, high \= 7\. mid \= (4+7)/2 \= 5\. a is 21\. Since 21==21, the target is found at index 5\.

4\. Solution (Complexity Analysis):  
A brute-force approach would be to iterate through each element and then, for that element, iterate through the entire array again to count its occurrences.

function findMode(array a of size n)  
    max\_count \= 0  
    mode \= a  
    for i \= 1 to n  
        current\_count \= 0  
        for j \= 1 to n  
            if a\[j\] \== a\[i\]  
                current\_count \= current\_count \+ 1  
            end if  
        end for  
        if current\_count \> max\_count  
            max\_count \= current\_count  
            mode \= a\[i\]  
        end if  
    end for  
    return mode

**Analysis:** The code has two nested for loops, each running from 1 to n. The inner loop executes n times for each execution of the outer loop. Therefore, the total number of comparisons is roughly n×n=n2. The Big-O time complexity is O(n2).

**5\. Hint (Short Proof):**

* **Base Case:** For n=1, the sum is 1\. The formula gives 21(1+1)​=1. The formula holds.  
* **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the formula is true for some integer k ≥ 1\. That is, assume 1+2+⋯+k=2k(k+1)​.  
* **Inductive Step:** Prove the formula is true for k+1. We need to show that 1+2+⋯+k+(k+1)=2(k+1)((k+1)+1)​.  
  * Start with the left side: (1+2+⋯+k)+(k+1).  
  * By the inductive hypothesis, substitute the sum in the parentheses: 2k(k+1)​+(k+1).  
  * Now, use algebra to combine the terms and show they equal the right side of the equation.

## **Extension Questions**

**1\. A Faster Way to Find Duplicates:** The "Transform and Conquer" strategy for finding duplicates in an array involves sorting it first, which has a time complexity of O(nlogn). Can you design an algorithm that solves this problem in O(n) time on average? (Hint: Think about data structures that provide fast lookups, like a hash set).

**2\. Breaking the Greedy Choice:** Consider the change-making problem for an amount of 40¢ with the coin system {1, 5, 10, 20, 25}. Trace the greedy algorithm's solution and compare it to the true optimal solution. What property of this coin system causes the greedy algorithm to fail?
